<h1>SAPO and Opensource</h1>

<p>
SAPO is the biggest Portuguese Website. It was born in 1995 at the University of Aveiro by the hands of six students and begun its journey as a Web directory and a national search engine. Today SAPO is part of the Portugal Telecom group, has a network of hundreds of content partners, provides all kinds of services to its users and can be accessed from multiple devices, including the PC, Mobile Phones, IPTV and connected TVS. It's visited by over 1.5 million users daily.
</p>

<p>
At the core of our culture there is a strong commitment with the Opensource values. We begun with a small FreeBSD server running httpd, burning our pages with the help of awk, bash, perl and mSQL. Today, 16 years later, our ~1000 server infrastructure runs mostly on Linux and our business relies on many Opensource initiatives and projects. The list would be big. Fundamentally speaking, not much has changed.
</p>

<p>
Through the years we've doing our part of the job, honoring the principles behind free software, and contributing to many projects as well as releasing and maintaining some of our products and core components to the Opensource community.
</p>

<p>
Here, at Github, you can find some of those projects, appropriate documentation, pointers to our history log and other OSS endeavours. If you have questions please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:github@sapo.pt">github@sapo.pt</a>.

<p>
Thank you.
