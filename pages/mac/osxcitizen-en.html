    <h2>What is it?</h2>

    <p>This was the first fully working implementation of Portuguese Citizen Card support atop Opensc.Tokend, with native-grade Mac OS X integration.</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>The government-issued Portuguese Citizen Card software for Mac was, unfortunately, only compatible with Firefox.</p>

    <p>That has since been fixed (there is now <a href="http://www.cartaodecidadao.pt/index.php%3Foption=com_content&task=view&id=102&Itemid=44&lang=pt.html">a fully working set of official packages</a>), but the original version did not take advantage of Mac OS X native security frameworks and lacked proper keychain integration (and, in consequence, lack of support for Mail.app and Safari).</p>

    <p>This project fixed that by reimplementing the required functionality atop OpenSC Tokend, a standards-compliant, cross-platform framework that allowed for fully native integration and extensibility, thereby vastly improving the user experience and allowing for further app integration.</p>

    <h2>Source Code Archive</h2>

    <p>Although the project has since been discontinued, we've made available the final version of the source code <a href="https://github.com/sapo/osxcitizen">from our Git repo</a>. For checking out the code use the git command line client as follows:</p>
